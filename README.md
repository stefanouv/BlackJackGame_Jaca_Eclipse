Game 21 (Blackjack)
The game 21 (or Blackjack) is a popular card game where the goal is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. In this game, players compete against the dealer (or the "mama").

Rules of the Game
Objective of the game: The goal of the game is to have the sum of the values of your cards as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Card Values:

The numbered cards have their face value (e.g., 2, 3, 4, etc.).

The J, Q, and K (face cards) are worth 10.

The A (Ace) can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on what is more advantageous for the player. However, in this version, the Ace is worth 1 â€” the 11 option is not available yet.

Gameplay:

At the start of the game, the player will receive the first cards.

The player clicks on the face-down card, and with each click, a new card is revealed in front of them.

When the player wants to stop, they press the "stop" button.

After the player stops, it is the dealer's (mama's) turn. The dealer also draws cards using the same steps, stopping when they no longer want a card.

Winner: The winner is the player or the dealer whose hand is closest to 21 without exceeding it.

How to Play the Game
Start: Open the program and run the game.

Interaction with the Game:

At the beginning of the game, the player will be the first to receive cards.

The player clicks on the face-down card, and with each click, a new card will be revealed.

When the player wants to stop, they press the "stop" button.

After that, it's the dealer's (mama's) turn, and they draw cards in the same way, stopping when they don't want more cards.

Result: Once the player presses "stop," the dealer's (mama's) hand is calculated, and the sum of both players' hands is displayed. A message will appear showing who won.
